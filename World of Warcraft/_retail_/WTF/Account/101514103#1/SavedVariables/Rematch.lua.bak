["notes"] = "Xu-Fu's Pet Guides =^_^=\nhttps://www.wow-petguide.com/Strategy/13636\n\nStrategy added by Amrôth#2849\nRNG: No RNG-tag because the strategy works very reliably with the pets I used, but it may occur that you have to adapt it a bit based on what's happening. Potential dangers are bad luck with Flurry hits (low dmg output) and the 10% chance to miss abilities because of blinded from Call Darkness. None of this makes you instantly lose the match though. The most important thing is to dodge enemy abilities.\n\nThe strategy probably also works with many other breeds. I did it with Mountain Cottontail B/B, Frostfur Rat P/S and Alpine Hare S/S. Let me know which other breeds work in the comments. Minimum speed as specified above is required.\n\nScript thanks to Offshore\n\n\nTurn 1: Dodge (Dodge enemy Horn Attack and Smash)\nTurn 2-3: 2x Flurry (Get hit by enemy Stampede 1)\nTurn 4-5: Burrow (Dodge enemy Stampede 2 / Get hit by enemy Stampede 3)\nTurn 6: Dodge (Dodge enemy Horn Attack and Smash)\nTurn 7-8: 2x Flurry\nThrugtusk dies / Wumpas comes in\nTurn 9: Flurry\nMountain Cottontail dies / Bring in your Frostfur Rat\nTurn 10: Call Darkness\nTurn 11-13: 3x Sneak Attack\nTurn 14: Refuge (Dodge enemy Headbutt)\nTurn 15-16: 2x Sneak Attack\nWumpas dies / Baeloth comes in\nTurn 17: Call Darkness\nTurn 18-19: 2x Sneak Attack\nFrostfur Rat dies / Bring in your Alpine Hare\nTurn 20: Dodge (Dodge enemy Thrash and Roar)\nTurn 21: Flurry\nTurn 22-23: Burrow (Dodge enemy Thrash)\nTurn 24: Flurry\nTurn 25: Flurry\nTurn 26: Dodge (Dodge enemy Thrash and Roar)\nTurn 27: Flurry\nBaeloth dies\n",

When you don't have 3x of them, I guess someone in your Guild, etc. can help out.**Can't easily script the optimal Early Advantage usage, because scripts can't foresee our pet's HP (unfortunately Early Advantage doesn't really deal \"double damage\", it just does a 2nd hit when your HP is still lower after the 1st hit), so I'm just firing it when our pet's HP is lower at the start of a round.\n\nInfo:: Never refresh existing Void Tremors!

Beeks kills Voidskimmer (don't even go further, Script will also immediately Forfeit)2.

Family Battler is a one-time thing, so please be patient or just try another strategy that suits you better.For the 3rd Slot, there are tons of alternate Nazjatar Slimy pets with that move set, but I only tried with the B/B Hermit, so I added its stats as a requirement.There are two situations when continuing makes little to no sense:1. Beeks kills Voidskimmer (don't even go further, Script will also immediately Forfeit)2. Voidskimmer dies without affecting Talons (I don't recommend going further, I don't think you can win without critical hits, and the Script will Forfeit unless you comment that line out or delete it)\n\nTurn 1: Pump\nTurn 2: Prowl\nTurn 3: Pump\nTurns 4+: Rush (Fethres dies, Beeks comes in, spam until dead)\nBring in your Voidskimmer and stick to these priorities:\nPrio 1:: When Beeks kills your Voidskimmer -> Forfeit\nPrio 2:: Void Tremors\nPrio 3:: Feedback\nSlimy Hermit Crab comes in\nTurn 1: When Voidskimmer didn't apply Void Tremors OR deal direct damage to Talons -> Forfeit (or ignore this when you wanna try to kill Talons with critical hits ;-)\nStick to these priorities:\nPrio 1:: No Void Tremors active, Talons has 968HP or more -> Sewage Eruption\nPrio 2:: Moonfire\nPrio 3:: Nether Blast\n",

You can use Immolation first cast only, but you will risk Gyrexle healing out because Failsafe didn't trigger.
