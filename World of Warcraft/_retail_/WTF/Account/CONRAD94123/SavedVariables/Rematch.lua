You can use Immolation first cast only, but you will risk Gyrexle healing out because Failsafe didn't trigger. I think it has something to do with different backline/weather abilities affecting the Gyrexle's health in a way that causes them to use Repair late/early enough.Managed to [url=https://pastebin.com/raw/xsay3pFH ]succeed with a crit of[/url] Rot.

["notes"] = "Strategy added by Berendain\n9.0.2 Update:  Adjusted TD script to account for the questionable buffs to weather abilities, including Sunlight, Moonfire, and Cleansing Rain, which are all present in this fight.  The fight is slightly less reliable now because Dignity heals for more with Cleansing Rain, but that will only matter if you get incredibly unlucky and don't crit during Hawk Eye.This strategy allows you to level any level one pet.  It doesn't need to have a certain amount of health, it won't take damage at all.  The leveling pet must be in the second slot for this to work.I recommend the Sprite Darter Hatchling if you have one, due to its higher health.  You can use an S/S Nether Faerie Dragon, but you'll risk having to restart if Beauty and Conviction land too many crits for your Faerie Dragon to survive the third turn against Conviction.  \n\nTurn 1: Decoy\nTurn 2: Swap to your Sprite Darter Hatchling\nTurn 3: Life Exchange\nTurn 4: Moonfire\nTurns 5-7: Arcane Blast until Beauty dies\nConviction comes in\nTurn 1: Pass\nTurn 2: Life Exchange\nTurn 3: Moonfire\nTurn 4: Arcane Blast\nTurn 4: Swap to your Level Pet  -  Conviction uses Dark Rebirth\nTurn 5: Swap to your Sprite Darter Hatchling  -  it dies\nBring in your Mechanical Axebeak\nTurn 1: Decoy\nTurn 2: Hawk Eye\nTurn 3: Alpha Strike  -  Conviction dies\nDignity comes in\nTurn 1: Alpha Strike until Dignity dies\n",

Family Battler is a one-time thing, so please be patient or just try another strategy that suits you better.For the 3rd Slot, there are tons of alternate Nazjatar Slimy pets with that move set, but I only tried with the B/B Hermit, so I added its stats as a requirement.There are two situations when continuing makes little to no sense:1. Beeks kills Voidskimmer (don't even go further, Script will also immediately Forfeit)2. Voidskimmer dies without affecting Talons (I don't recommend going further, I don't think you can win without critical hits, and the Script will Forfeit unless you comment that line out or delete it)\n\nTurn 1: Pump\nTurn 2: Prowl\nTurn 3: Pump\nTurns 4+: Rush (Fethres dies, Beeks comes in, spam until dead)\nBring in your Voidskimmer and stick to these priorities:\nPrio 1:: When Beeks kills your Voidskimmer -> Forfeit\nPrio 2:: Void Tremors\nPrio 3:: Feedback\nSlimy Hermit Crab comes in\nTurn 1: When Voidskimmer didn't apply Void Tremors OR deal direct damage to Talons -> Forfeit (or ignore this when you wanna try to kill Talons with critical hits ;-)\nStick to these priorities:\nPrio 1:: No Void Tremors active, Talons has 968HP or more -> Sewage Eruption\nPrio 2:: Moonfire\nPrio 3:: Nether Blast\n",

You may win in as short a time as 1:12.  On the other hand, if you get unlucky and miss Stumpers' Cute Face several times in a row, the fight may take much longer.  The longest the fight has taken me was 1:55, after I missed Stumpers four times.The TD script works if you're using an Abyssal Eel, which has Acid Rain instead of Cleansing Rain.

When you don't have 3x of them, I guess someone in your Guild, etc. can help out.**Can't easily script the optimal Early Advantage usage, because scripts can't foresee our pet's HP (unfortunately Early Advantage doesn't really deal \"double damage\", it just does a 2nd hit when your HP is still lower after the 1st hit), so I'm just firing it when our pet's HP is lower at the start of a round.\n\nInfo:: Never refresh existing Void Tremors! While facing Fethres or Beeks, you can apply Void Tremors for the next enemy, but make sure your next attack will kill the active enemy so it's not wasted.\n\nStick to these priorities on all your pets, bring next pet when one dies:\n!: Skip Prio 1-3 when Void Tremors is active! (didnt wanna add this to each line)\nPrio 1:: Enemy has 1102HP or more -> Void Tremors\nPrio 2:: Enemy is not Talons, enemy has 734HP or less, Early Advantage is usable or ready next turn, and your HP is lower**) -> Void Tremors\nPrio 3:: Enemy is not Talons, enemy has 367HP or less -> Void Tremors\nPrio 4:: Your pet has lower HP than the enemy -> Early Advantage**\nPrio 5:: Scratch\n",
