## Changes

Updated for patch 10.2.6.

### Minimize in combat

Loot/Voting frames triggered while in combat will now automatically be minimized if `Minimize in combat` is enabled.

### Group updates

People joining late, or just before a pull now has a much higher chance of receiving required data from the group leader, which should fix most instances of those people not autopassing group loot.

### Loot Status

Removed - hasn't been used since group loot was introduced, and was essentially just using up comms bandwidth.

### Weapons auto pass

By default, RCLootCouncil will now auto pass weapons that you either can't use, or doesn't have the appropiate main stat for your class (e.g. agility weapons for priests). It can be turned off in the response options if needed.

## Bugfixes

- *Fixed issue with importing corrupt history data.*
- *Fixed formatting of item status string for items with extended info such as 'Shadowflame Suffused'.*
