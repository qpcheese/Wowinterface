Battle Pet Daily Tamer puts a paw on the world map to mark where daily pet tamers are that you have not completed for the day.

From the tracking menu on the world map you can choose to selectively disable/enable:
- Reward Dailies (green paw): These are dailies that reward a pet supply satchel, pet charm or token to buy pet supplies.
- Normal Dailies (blue paw): These are dailies that reward xp but no extra rewards.
- Legendary (orange paw): These are either the Beasts of Fable quests (if you've picked them up) or the Tanaan Jungle legendaries.
- Inactive Dailies (grey paw): These are either dailies that have been completed or are otherwise unavailable, such as Broken Isle world quests that are not active. This is off by default.
- On Flight Maps Too (flying boot): This setting will show paws on the flight map, so you can choose where to fly closest to a daily. It is off by default.
- Stable Masters (horseshoe): This setting will display a horseshoe on the zone map where stable masters are located. It is off by default.
