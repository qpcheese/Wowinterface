- TOC bump  
- Vendor tracking is now somewhat more compatible with AddOns that adjust the vendor UI - though still with severe limitations  
- GetItemInfoFromHyperlink hasn't moved to C\_Item  
- C\_Item changes for 10.2.6  
- Pandaria Prospecting will now be ignored as a valid recipe, because it does in fact not create Shadowed Alloy as the API might have us believe  
- Close buttons are now aligned in the same way as in the base UI  
- Russian pages using "/" instead of "of" messed with my regex. >:
