# Profession Shopping List
A World of Warcraft AddOn that adds a shopping list for tracked recipes.

Profession Shopping List is an AddOn that allows you to track recipes, and shows you the materials you need to craft them.
It does not replace the profession windows, it only adds a few buttons and a tracking window.

**If you are experiencing issues**
- Use `/psl clear`. Some new versions come with logic changes, and then it is necessary to clear the tracked recipes once.
- If the issues remain, or you have other feedback, feel free to join the [All The Things Discord](https://discord.gg/allthethings) and ask in the #profession-shopping-list Retail channel, or create a [ticket on GitHub](https://github.com/Sluimerstand/ProfessionShoppingList/issues). :)
