# Media: Newsom

**Media: Newsom** adds my custom media to your [LibSharedMedia](https://www.wowace.com/projects/libsharedmedia-3-0) for use within other addons.

**Note:** Most of the useful textures as well as 1 sound is now included in [WeakAuras2](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2), rendering this addon more or less obsolete unless you want the extra sounds and/or icon textures.

Some screenshots:

*All of these bar textures are now included in WeakAuras2 with no need for this addon*
