## Notes
This addon is experimental; don't rely on the logout skip locations too much.  To use this addon, open the map and click the `Show LogoutSkips` button.  Red `x`'s are locations where the logout skips will teleport you to. The red lines are Voronoi partitions which act as boundaries between different logout skip teleport locations.  The idea is that if you perform a logout skip, you will be teleported to the location indicated by the `x` that is within the polygon that you are in.
