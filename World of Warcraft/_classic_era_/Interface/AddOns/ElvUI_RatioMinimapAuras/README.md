# Ratio Minimap Auras (ElvUI Plugin)

**Do you disable the Keep Aspect Ratio option on your auras on your nameplates, unitframes, or even your actionbars to make them rectangle instead of the standard square?**  
**Did you realize that there was no such option for the Buffs and Debuffs next to the Minimap?**

### Well there isn't, well wasn't, one until now.
Ratio Minimap Auras allows you to have separate width and height (Disabling the Keep Aspect Ratio option) for your buffs and debuffs by the minimap.
The option is located in the Buffs and Debuffs section of the ElvUI configuration frame.Â  Under each section (Buffs/Debuffs) there is now a Size group with the new options.
